# cShare

![cshare Logo](./cshare.png?raw=true)

A command-line tool to share sensitive text data across devices owned by you.

## ðŸ’¡ Motivation

With my old potato PC, I was converting it into my home server for streaming, remote development, and experimenting with random stuff. For this installation, I decided to go with [Manjaro](https://manjaro.org/) as my base OS.

>Manjaro is a free and open-source operating system based on Arch Linux. It uses the same package manager (Pacman) and build system (AUR) as Arch. It is considered a secure operating system as it uses the Linux kernel and a variety of security-focused software and practices. Manjaro also follows the Arch Linux security policy and actively monitors it; overall, it's very secure.

I wasn't able to SSH to my home server because of Manjaro's security. I needed to share some security keys from my Mac with the server. I tried everything I could to copy my key but couldn't.

I needed a simple tool that I could instal just like curl (`pacman -S curl`). I didn't even know about`scp` or maybe I needed to tweak some firewall settings. Ultimately, I decided to build cShare. This is how I was inspired to make this app.

## âš™ Working

- It can be installed using a single command, "go instal github.com/JammUtkarsh/cshare," just like any other CLI app.Behind the scenes, it fetches the source code from the repository temporarily, builds it, and stores the binary in `$GOROOT/bin`. If this path is added to your shell, then you can access it like any other command.
- The data is centrally stored on the [server](https://github.com/JammUtkarsh/cshare-server). cShare queries the database via HTTP requests.
- in `$HOME/.cshare/config.json` which contains the JWT token required for each subsequent request.

## ðŸ”§ How we built it

- [Cobra](https://github.com/spf13/cobra) is used to build the app's basic structure and subcommands.
- [Viper](https://github.com/spf13/viper) manages the configuration and its storage mechanisms.
- The standard library is used for other operations such as making an HTTP request and displaying the test.
